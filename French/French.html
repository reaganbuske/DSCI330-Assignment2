	Welcome to the French Program at WSU. The Department of Global Studies and Foreign Languages is planning to restructure French program offerings with the intent of reintroducing the option to minor in French. Therefore, the content, numbering and/or credit hours for French will likely be revised. To obtain the latest course offerings and the status of the French minor, please contact our office.

Currently we are offering a variety of 100-200 level French language courses. This spring we will have French 101, 102 and 201 (open to students having completed 102 or one course in the 200-level series). Next fall we will offer the new French 305 Special Topics Course on Bohemian Paris! If you are unsure of what course to take for your level of French, please contact Sarah Jones-Boardman
